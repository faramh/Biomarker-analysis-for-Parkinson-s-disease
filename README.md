This is a part of the big project to explore many of biomarkers in people living with Parkinson's that we can extract from EEG and behavioral measures

In this project we aim to check and evaluate many biomarkers that can make a distinction between PD patients and HC people (Healthy control). These biomarkers are discussed and has been used in literature of Parkinson research. However we want to bting them togther and find the most valid one's. Our group's final goal is to find the best features of PD to feed a weak supervision what can accurately classify PD patients and also track the syptoms of disease which is crucial for treatment and neuromodulation control.

By our method of neuromodulation for PD patients which is GVS stimulation we can optimize our treatment based on this biomarkers in a close future. Each step that get us closer to any control this disease is a big pleasure for our group.

A brief list of biomarkers
Entropy Measurments like ApEN, SampEn , PE
Complexity measurments like OI and Fractal dimension
Asymetry measurments
PAC features of signal
